This Shiny app allows you to calculate the probability of being less than or equal to a value or to calculate the value that has specified probability of being less than or equal to it. The calculator gives these values for binomial, continuous uniform, normal and t distributions.

For a random variable with a given distribution, a **quantile** is the value from the distribution such that the probability of being less than or equal to it is a specified probability. Select the *Quantile* tab to find a quantile given a probability. Select the *Probability* tab to find a probability given a quantile.
