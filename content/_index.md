title: "Introduction to Statistical Ideas and Methods"
---

These resources are designed for use in STA220: The Practice of Statistics I at the University of Toronto. No mathematics prerequisites are assumed beyond the secondary school level.

The materials are organized into modules which consist of a sequence of learning activities, typically short video lectures, notes, and interactive applications.  You are encouraged to watch the versions of the lecture videos which have quiz questions embedded in them (UTORid authentication is required). These embedded questions will not form part of your evaluation. They are there to allow you to self-evaluate how well you are following along.

Several datasets are used throughout these resources. Introductions to the datasets and links to download them are available on the [Data page]({{< ref "/Data" >}}). Each week, you should begin by familiarizing yourself with the data used in the learning resources for that week.
