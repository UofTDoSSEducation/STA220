Are babies slower to learn to crawl when the weather is colder? The babies crawling data were collected in a study to investigate this question. Babies in the study who grouped by the month of the year in which they were born. The [data file BabiesCrawlingData.txt](../BabiesCrawlingData.txt) includes the following variables:

- **birth_month** — the month of the year in which the babies were born
- **avg_crawling_age** — the average age in weeks at which the babies born that month learned to crawl, averaged over all babies born that month
- **temperature** — the average temperature for the month six months after the birth month.
