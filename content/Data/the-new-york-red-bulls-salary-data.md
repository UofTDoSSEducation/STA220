The New York Red Bulls are a Major League Soccer (MLS) team. The data are the salaries of the 25 players who were on the team in May 2012. The data were downloaded from [Big Apple Soccer](http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/teams/redbulls2.php?article_id=30451) (the link is no longer valid).

There are rules regarding player compensation in the MLS. Here is a simplified version of three of the rules:

1. There is a minimum salary that teams must pay their players.
2. Teams can acquire up to three players for whom there are no restrictions on how high their salaries can be. These are known as Designated Players. In May 2012, the the New York Red Bulls team included French striker Thierry Henry (who was the highest paid player in the MLS at the time) and Mexican defender Rafael MÃ¡rquez.
3. There is a salary cap (a maximum total amount) for the salaries of all players on a team, excluding the Designated Players.

When examining these data through plots and summary statistics, it is possible to see reflections of each of these rules.
