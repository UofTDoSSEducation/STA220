Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemicals that were developed in the 1930’s and used as propellants in aerosol cans and for refrigeration.  Because they were found to contribute to depletion of the ozone layer, their use has been phased out under the schedule agreed to by the 1987 Montreal Protocol.

The data in the [data file CFCdata.txt](../CFCdata.txt) were downloaded from the [World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases](https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/) (external link is no longer valid).  The data file contains the following variables:

- **year**
- **month**
- **time** — a numeric variable measuring month as fraction of a year
- **cfc11** — the monthly mean atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 measured at the top of Mauna Loa in Hawaii
