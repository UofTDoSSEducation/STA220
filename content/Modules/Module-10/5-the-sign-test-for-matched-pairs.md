title: "The Sign Test for Matched Pairs"

Non-parametric methods in statistics include methods which do not rely on an assumption that the data are observations from a particular probability distribution. In this video, weâ€™ll see one of those methods, the sign test for matched pairs.

### Calculating Binomial Probabilities

The sign test uses the binomial probability distribution. To calculate binomial probabilities, you can use the [binomial distribution probability table](../BinomialDistributionTable.pdf) or the [probability distribution calculator](https://rconnect.utstat.utoronto.ca/distributionalcalculator/). Both the table and the app are available on the menu under [Probability Distribution Calculator]({{< ref "Calculator" >}}).
