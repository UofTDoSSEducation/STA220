4. The Schizophrenia Data  
In a 1990 study, researchers used MRI to measure the volumes of various regions of the brain. Measurements were taken on 15 monozygotic twins, where one twin was affected by schizophrenia (“affected”) and the other not (“unaffect”). The data we consider are the volumes of the left hippocampus region in cubic centimetres.  
  
This example was taken from F. Ramsey and D. Schafer, The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis, 2nd edition, Duxbury, 2002, Case 2.1.2. The data are available in the [R library Sleuth2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Sleuth2/Sleuth2.pdf) (external link, opens in new window) and the data values can be seen in the video [The Sign Test]({{< ref "/Modules/the-sign-test" >}}) and accompanying notes.
