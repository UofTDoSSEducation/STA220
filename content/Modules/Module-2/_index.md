### By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe and give examples of how randomness occurs,
- Distinguish between problems involving combinations of events for which multiplication rules are appropriate and for which addition rules are appropriate,
- Identify events that are independent and events that are mutually exclusive / disjoint and mathematically justify their identification,
- Use addition rules, multiplication rules, probability of the complement of an event, and tree diagrams to solve a variety of probability problems,
- Apply the conditional probability formula and Bayes’ rule to solve conditional probability problems.
