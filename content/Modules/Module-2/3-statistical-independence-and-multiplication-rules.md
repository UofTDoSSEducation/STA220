Two events are independent if knowing about one of the events tells you nothing about the probability of the other event. Combining this idea with the formula for conditional probability gives us a multiplication rule for finding the probability that two events both occur and a mathematical check for whether two events are independent.

### A point to consider for this video:

Rearranging the formula for conditional probability gives the general multiplication rule for the probability that two events A and B both occur:

*P(A and B) = P(A|B) Ã— P(B)*

How does this simplify when A and B are independent events?
