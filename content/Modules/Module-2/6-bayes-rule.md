[Notes on the video: Bayes’ Rule](../4-6-Bayes-Rules.pdf)

### A point to consider for this video:

Problems for which Bayes’ rule is useful can often be identified when the statement of the problem involves the conditional probability of one event given another, but the question asks for the reverse conditional probability, that is the probability of the second event given the first.
