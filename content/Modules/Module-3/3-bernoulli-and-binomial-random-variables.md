Many random events have two possible outcomes: either something happens or it doesn’t. In this video, we’ll look at random variables for this situation, and for the related situation in which we count the number of times something happens in a fixed number of trials.

### Calculating Binomial Probabilities

Binomial probabilities can be calculated using the formula for the binomial distribution probability mass function. However, we have not introduced that formula and you are not responsible for using it in this course. To calculate binomial probabilities, you can use the binomial distribution probability table or the probability distribution calculator. Both the table and the app are available on the menu under Probability Distribution Calculator.
