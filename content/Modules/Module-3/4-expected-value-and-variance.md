The mean and standard deviance (or variance) of a set of measurements are two common statistics to capture the centre and spread of the data. In this sequence of videos, we will see analogous measures of centre and spread for random variables and their corresponding probability distributions.

### A point to consider for this video:

The **expected value** of a random variable is also commonly called the random variable’s **expectation** or the **mean** of the random variable. The next video discusses this use of the word “mean” versus the use of the word “mean” for the average of some data values.

### A point to consider for this video:

*Common notation for random variables and the corresponding values for sample data*: The Greek letter μ is typically used for the mean (expected value) of a random variable, that is for a random variable *X, E(X)=μ*. The symbol *x̅* is typically used for a sample mean calculated from data. For standard deviation, the Greek letter *σ* is used for the standard deviation (the square root of the variance) of a random variable while s is used for the sample standard deviation calculated from data.
