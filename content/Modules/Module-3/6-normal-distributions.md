title: "Normal Distributions"
---
Normal distributions are good models for the randomness in many situations and are the basis for many statistical methods. In this sequence of videos, weâ€™ll examine the properties of normal distributions and how to assess whether a set of data appear to be a sample of measurements from a normal distribution.

### Using a Normal Probability Table

A normal probability table can be used to find probabilities and quantiles for values from the standard normal distribution. In this video, we demonstrate how to use a table. The particular [normal probability table](../../../extraresources/NormalDistributionTable.pdf) used in the video is from [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php) (external link, opens in new window) (licensed under the Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license).

In practice, statistical software is typically used to obtain probabilities and quantiles from normal distributions. The [Probability Distribution Calculator]({{< ref "/Calculator" >}}) is an app that can be used for this.

### Normal Quantile Plots

Normal quantile plots (sometimes called Q-Q plots because they plot quantiles from data versus the corresponding quantiles from a normal distribution) are useful graphical displays to assess whether a set of data appear to be a sample of measurements from a normal distribution.
