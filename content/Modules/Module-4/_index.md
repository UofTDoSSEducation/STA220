### By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe how sampling distributions reflect the distribution of statistics from different samples of data,
- Describe the long run behaviour of the distribution of averages of outcomes of random experiments, including both proportions and sample means,
- Connect the variability in the original measurements to the variability in the sample mean,
- Explain why the normal distribution plays an important role in statistics.
