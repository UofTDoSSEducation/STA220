One of the most important results in probability and statistics is the Central Limit Theorem. It tells us how averages of random measurements behave.

### A point to consider for this video:

A natural question to ask is: *How large of a sample size is needed so that the approximation to the Normal distribution is close enough for the probability distribution of an average?* Unfortunately, there is no general answer. In many situations, a sample size of 10 is enough. But when the probability distribution of the individual observations has outliers or is very skewed, a much larger sample size is necessary.
