title: "Confidence Intervals for Proportions"
---

Confidence intervals for proportions are commonly quoted in news reports for polls, typically as the “margin of error, 19 times out of 20.” In this video we’ll see how a confidence interval for a proportion is constructed, to give a range of plausible values for the proportion in the population or the theoretical world based on the estimated proportion we’ve observed in the real world.

### A point to consider for this video:

Substituting 1/2 for *p* in the margin of error of a confidence interval is one way to deal with the fact that we don’t know the theoretical world proportion. Why might substituting in the estimated value of *p* be preferred?
