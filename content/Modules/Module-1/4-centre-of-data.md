[Notes on the video: The Centre of the Data and the Effects of Extreme Values](../1-2-The-Centre-Of-The-Data-And-The-Effects-Of-Extreme-Values.pdf)

### Some points to consider for this video:

- How does a modified box plot illustrate extreme values?
- What does it mean for a measure of centre to be robust?
- There are no set rules for what percentage of the data should be trimmed in a trimmed mean. The goal is to remove the extreme observations. If fact, you can trim as much as 50%. What is another name for the 50% trimmed mean?
