### By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the purpose and interpretation of confidence intervals for means,
- Identify the quantities that are random and not random in the construction of - confidence interval for means,
- Describe the t-distribution and explain when it should be used and how it differs from a Normal distribution,
- Apply the sampling distribution of the sample mean to calculate confidence intervals,
- State the meaning of robust when used to describe coverage of a confidence interval, recall the role of sample size in the robustness of a confidence interval, and recognize situations when confidence intervals for means and for proportions are not robust.
