Suppose we flip a coin and get heads 60% of time. Is that an indication that our coin is biased, in other words that it is not equally likely to come up heads or tails? Or could the fact that we didn’t get 50% heads just be due to chance? Similarly, if a new treatment shows improved results, or a new experiment contradicts a value from existing theory, should we conclude that these results are meaningful, or just part of the natural variability that can occur? In this video, you’ll be introduced to how statistical testing can be used to help answer these questions.
