### A point to consider for this video:

This video refers to a City of Toronto poll, carried out early in the term of Mayor Rob Ford, before some controversies overshadowed his term.

In this video, the P-values are often given as fractions. These P-values were calculated to many decimal places using statistical software, and then converted to an approximate fraction to emphasize how small they are.
