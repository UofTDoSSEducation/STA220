title: "Hypothesis Testing for Means"
---

Suppose we have some measurements of a quantitative variable and we calculate the average of these measurements. We can compare our average to a previously established mean or to the value that a scientific model says that the mean should be, that is to the theoretical world mean. Itâ€™s unlikely that the average calculated from our data is exactly equal to the theoretical world mean, but can we attribute the difference to just chance? Or is there evidence that something else is going on? This video covers how to carry out a statistical test when we are interested in the mean of a quantitative variable.

### A point to consider for this video:

In this video, the P-values are often given as fractions. These P-values were calculated to many decimal places using statistical software, and then converted to an approximate fraction to emphasize how small they are.
