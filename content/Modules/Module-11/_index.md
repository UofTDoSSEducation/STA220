## By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the purpose of linear regression and how a regression line is estimated,
- Demonstrate appropriate use of the vocabulary and notation of linear regression,
- Use linear regression to describe the relationship between an independent and dependent variable,
- Interpret the regression line,
- Connect the estimated regression line to the corresponding scatterplot and correlation,
- Apply appropriate inferential methods for the slope of the line to determine whether a linear relationship exists,
- Use graphical displays, including residual plots, to assess whether a regression line is appropriate to describe the relationship between two quantitative variables, and whether related inferential methods are appropriate,
- Identify situations in which a log transformation is appropriate and interpret results of a linear regression in which the data have been log transformed.
