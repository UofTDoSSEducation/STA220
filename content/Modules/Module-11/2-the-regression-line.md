Regression is one of the most commonly used statistical methods. It can be used to create a model for predicting the value of an outcome variable from the values of one more explanatory variables, including giving an estimate of the error in the prediction. Alternatively, it can be used to investigate how and if the outcome is related to the explanatory variable. Simple linear regression covers the case of the linear relationship between one outcome variable and one explanatory variable.
